## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned:

- How to work with Python data structures to manage words.
- How to use loops and conditionals for game logic.
- How to create an interactive text-based game.


## Installation

1. Clone the Hangman project repository from GitHub.

## Usage
Run the game using the instructions provided in the "Installation" section.

Start the game by guessing one letter at a time.

Continue guessing letters until you either:

Successfully guess the word.
Exceed the maximum allowed incorrect guesses.
